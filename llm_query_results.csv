5,Such a lovely scent but not overpowering.,"This spray is really nice. It smells really good, goes on really fine, and does the trick.

4,Works great but smells a little weird.,"This product does what I need it to do, I just wish it was odorless or had a soft coconut smell. Having my head smell like an orange coffee is offputting.

5,Nice shampoo for the money,"I get Keratin treatments at the salon at least 3-4 times a year (would do it more often if I could afford it). I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair.

3,Not what I thought I would be getting,"I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges).

5,A little goes a long way!,"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin.

3,Just ok,"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments.

5,Good quality hair brush!,"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best.

5,Great refreshing skin care routine!,"I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month.

3,Didn't do much and difficult to place and maintain on your face,"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily.

5,"Quality hair iron, works perfectly to straighten my hair!","This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair.

5,Great all natural ear swabs!,"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily.

5,Wonderful overnight cream!,"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",[],B07W397QG4,B07W397QG4,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,2020-06-28 13:53:42.858,1,False,Overnight cream relieves dry skin easily.
5,This really works!,"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",[],B07GDQPG12,B07GDQPG12,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,2019-01-15 22:04:03.451,0,False,Roller helps with serum absorption.
5,Nice manicure set for men or women,"This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college.

5,Great combo pack. Wish I had been using this years ago!,"I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together.

3,I just don't get it,"I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean.

1,halo hair extensions,"This halo hair extension is simply put, garbage.  Now, you get what you pay for.  And this is a very cheap version.  The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.

It isn't sticky though it does leave behind a little tackiness, but that disappears quickly. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do. I like it. It's definitely hydrating.

4,Smells Good!,"I enjoy sugar scrubs! They are wonderful for smoothing rough elbows. This one is a small container. I would consider it more of a travel size or sample size. It smells good. It's got a fruity/beachy smell to it. The scrub has a coarse texture which makes it better for exfoliating, yet I didn't have any troubles with it being too rough on my skin. It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor. I have had some scrubs that leave you feeling super greasy and waxy, but this one is more of a moderate level of greasiness.

4,Non-Irritating,"I am in my early fifties. I have been using anti-aging products for the past several years. This eye cream has minimal smell to it. The consistency is a thin cream. It's not runny, it's just not thick. I have sensitive eyes and this is non-irritating. My eyes water a lot and that often leads to product getting into my eyes and causing stinging and or burning in the eye area. This cream has not bothered me at all.

It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them.

I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works.

4,Great for Travel!,"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking.

4,Fun Way to Try Out a New Scent,"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out.

5,Best Face Wipes!,"I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.",[],B08FRQGYDF,B08FRQGYDF,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-11-13 18:27:40.685,0,False,Face wipes are very effective overall.
4,A Bit Oily,"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",[],B08BZ1RHPS,B08BZ1RHPS,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-08-20 16:59:04.359,3,False,Thick Vitamin C serum is acceptable.
4,Good Variety of Travel Size Skincare Products,"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.",[],B085NYYLQ8,B085NYYLQ8,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-08-15 21:25:01.753,0,False,Travel skincare kit meets expectations.
4,Nice Variety of Colors,"This set of gel nail polishes comes in a nice variety of colors. The brushes seem fairly comparable to other nail polishes. What I really like is that there is a little window on the front of each bottle that shows you the color. I've ordered some gel nail polishes that have no color identification on the bottle and I have had to paint (and tape over) a small dot of polish so I can identify them without opening. Overall, I am pleased with these.",[],B085WTCBLG,B085WTCBLG,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-06-26 16:56:34.550,0,False,Gel polish variety with clear identifier.
4,Comfortable Head Band,"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.",[],B088FBNQXW,B088FBNQXW,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-06-25 00:09:00.906,1,False,Helpful face mask headband solution
4,Good Hand Sanitizer!,"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.

4,Leaves Skin Feeling Soft,"I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.",[],B07PRDZ2BH,B07PRDZ2BH,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-05-07 15:33:12.842,0,False,Author finds face oil helpful finally.
4,Light Weight,"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either.

4,Soft,"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.",[],B082NKQ4ZT,B082NKQ4ZT,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-03-11 13:07:22.329,0,False,Soft headbands with good design.
3,Not The Right Target Audience,"I guess I'm not the right target audience for this Vitamin C/Retinol Moisturizer. I'm in my early fifties. Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin. Other than that issue, I didn't have any other problems with my sensitive skin.

4,Nice Fruity Scent,"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.",[],B07WNBZQGT,B07WNBZQGT,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-02-15 13:22:40.365,0,False,Serum moisturizes skin without irritation.
4,Non-Greasy,"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.",[],B07SW7D6ZR,B07SW7D6ZR,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-02-03 15:02:24.072,0,False,Body lotion absorbs quickly on skin.
4,Huge Bottle!,"Last summer I decided to grow out my bangs after having them for all of my adult life. I hadn't used much hairspray since the eighties and into the nineties, but I found that I needed to spray my former bangs in order to help train them to their new position. This is a huge bottle of hair spray. It has a standard hair spray smell. It gives a nice mist. It doesn't leave my hair crunchy. It's a flexible hold so my hair moves and looks natural. So far I am pleased with it.",[],B07JDD2L3M,B07JDD2L3M,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-01-18 12:44:21.183,0,False,Nice hairspray for bang control.
4,Easy to Use!,"As I have gotten older (I'm in my early fifties), I've noticed that my eyelashes have become sparser. This eyelash growth serum is easy to use. It doesn't sting or irritate my sensitive eyes either. I haven't seen much change in the length of my lashes yet, but I think I can see some new growth or density. I will continue using this and update my review if necessary.",[],B082MTTFZD,B082MTTFZD,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-01-18 01:59:40.004,1,False,Eyelash growth serum shows some progress.
5,Gentle!,"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.",[],B07NPWK167,B07NPWK167,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-01-13 15:08:09.878,0,False,Gentle goat milk cleanser soothes skin.
5,Moisturizing,"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.",[],B07J2QZBTP,B07J2QZBTP,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2019-12-22 14:19:15.925,0,False,Winters require good hand moisturizers.
4,Leaves Teeth Clean,"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use. As far as I can tell, there isn't a timer on it which would be nice. The bristles are pretty firm. I'm guessing maybe they are a medium. It does a good job of leaving my teeth clean.",[],B07N45YN6C,B07N45YN6C,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2019-07-08 01:44:25.320,0,False,Toothbrush works well for cleaning teeth.
3,Doesn't Irritate My Skin,"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.",[],B077YR3333,B077YR3333,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2019-02-19 15:04:57.518,0,False,Middle-aged woman tries anti-aging serum.
4,Easy to Use!,"My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.",[],B07FZ5HZLM,B07FZ5HZLM,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2019-01-21 17:46:13.968,0,False,Husband uses QuickBooks for accounting.
